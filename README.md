# Rust Boot Camp 🦀

A comprehensive Rust learning project designed to explore fundamental concepts and best practices in Rust programming.

## 📚 Project Overview

This project serves as a hands-on learning environment for Rust programming language fundamentals. It demonstrates various Rust concepts including:

- Module system and code organization
- Function definitions and usage
- Generic programming
- String handling and formatting
- Basic I/O operations

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust installed on your system (https://rustup.rs/)
- Basic understanding of programming concepts

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd rust-boot-camp
   ```

### Running the Project

```bash
# Compile and run the project
cargo run

# Check for compilation errors without running
cargo check

# Build the project (creates optimized executable)
cargo build --release
```

## 📁 Project Structure

└── target/             # Compiled artifacts (auto-generated)
```

### Key Rust Concepts Demonstrated

- **Modules**: Organization of code into separate files
- **Public Functions**: Using `pub` keyword for external access
- **Generics**: Type-safe generic programming with `<T>`
- **Traits**: Using trait bounds (`std::ops::Add<Output = T>`)
- **String Slices**: Working with `&str` references
- **Ownership**: Safe memory management without garbage collection

## 📖 Learning Objectives

By working with this project, you'll learn:

1. **Rust Project Structure**: How to organize a Rust project
2. **Module System**: How to split code across multiple files
3. **Function Definitions**: Creating reusable code blocks
4. **Generic Programming**: Writing type-safe, reusable code
5. **String Handling**: Working with Rust's string types
6. **Cargo Tool**: Building, running, and managing Rust projects

## 🎯 Next Steps for Learning

Consider extending this project by adding:

- [ ] Error handling with `Result<T, E>` and `Option<T>`
- [ ] Struct definitions and implementations
- [ ] Enums and pattern matching
- [ ] Collections (Vec, HashMap, etc.)
- [ ] File I/O operations
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] External crate dependencies
- [ ] Command-line argument parsing
- [ ] More advanced generic programming

## 📝 Example Output

When you run the project, you should see:

```
Hello, world! from myFunctions.rs
The result of adding 5 and 3 is: 8
The result of generic adding 10 and 20 is: 30
First Name: John, Last Name: Doe
```

## 🛠️ Development Commands

```bash
# Format code according to Rust standards
cargo fmt

# Run the linter for code quality
cargo clippy

# Run tests (when implemented)
cargo test

# Generate documentation
cargo doc --open
```
